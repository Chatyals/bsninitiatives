            Providing Information for a more Desired Humanitarian Action

        <p className="para3">
          <span>Beacon Support For The Needy Initiative (BSN)</span> is a
          leading global humanitarian initiative that aims to strengthen
          evidence-based decision-making by Non-Governmental Organizations
          (NGOs), civil society organisations (CSOs) and decision-makers through
          regular and efficient data collection, management and timely
          information and in-depth analysis from contexts of disaster, crisis
          and displacement. The work of BSN directly feeds into aid response by
          providing accessible and precise information on the humanitarian
          situation of crisis-affected populations in which felt needs of the
          vulnerable women and children and excluded are addressed. Created in
          2022, BSN will conduct activities in support of inter-agency
          coordination mechanisms in the field to enable more efficient aid
          planning and response.
