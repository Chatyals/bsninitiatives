  <h1>WHERE WE WORK</h1>
  <p>
    BSN works in places affected by crisis, disaster and displacement
    across the 36 States of Nigeria and FCT Abuja. In addition to
    ongoing support to humanitarian actors in protracted crisis, BSN
    deploys to rapid-onset crises ranging from natural disasters to
    sudden escalations of conflict. BSNâ€™s work directly supports
    evidence-based decision-making from the very early stages of
    humanitarian planning and delivery.

  <p>
    In north-east Nigeria, approximately 10 million people are affected
    by the humanitarian crisis, and since the start of the conflict in
    2009, more than 71,000 people have been killed and 2.7 million
    displaced. Furthermore, banditry and farmer-herder violence has
    killed more than 21,000 people and displaced hundreds of thousands
    of people. In spite of the turmoil and the critical humanitarian
    conditions faced by the conflict-affected populations, significant
    proportions of the displaced have begun to return to their areas of
    origin with over 6 million of people still in various camps across
    the country. Humanitarian actors working in Nigeria continue to face
    significant information gaps lacking required granular and
    comprehensive evidence to efficiently inform their response
    planning. BSN will continues to provide up to date data to support
    actors working to address the humanitarian needs of vulnerable
    groups.
